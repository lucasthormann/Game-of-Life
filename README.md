# ***Game-of-Life***
This program is the solution to the fifth homework assignment assigned in the Object Oriented Principals & Design course from the Computer Science Department of Texas State University during the Fall 2021 semester. It is an adapted implementation of John Conway's Game of Life in Java.

**Description**
* This program is an intelligent computer expert system designed for a medical professionals to use in order to diagnose cardiovascular diseases and to recommend the treatment based on the diagnosis. This software is intended to be used by hospital staff by feeding the symptoms of a patient to this expert system. This expert system will diagnose the specific Cardiovascular disease and will recommend the treatment. This system is implemented using both backward and forward chaining algorithms. In order to properly use this software the user must understand the meaning of the abbreviated symptoms, diseases, and treatments. The user can unerstand these abbreviates by reading the project report.

**Building on Windows/MAC/Linux**
* In order to properly build and run this program, you must install all of the included files.This software is capable of running on any digital, computational device capable of compiling and executing Java files. Once you have properly installed the files you should then open them in an IDE capable of compiling and executing Java files. Once the files are properly opened in a functional IDE, use the tools provided by the IDE to build and run the files.

**Dependencies**
* Install the latest version of an IDE capable of compiling and executing Java files

**Program Execution**
* I've used Eclipse IDE for running and debugging, so the execution could be done using the graphical interface of the IDE.
